##TODO List
- [ ] unified overall basic pathfinding system; probably the propagate-backwards method I described which gives us a route from any square on board to single target square
- [ ] rockets to get us to mars
- [ ] decide on general gameplan/strategy for sprint tournament (subject to change, pending sprint tourney results and scrimmage results)
- [ ] plan for how we're going to block research, considering what scenarios, if any, we want to change the order of said research
- [ ] worker logic that harvests karbonite and puts factories in not-dumb positions
- [ ] logic to "flag" surviving enemies in end-game so we hunt them down
- [ ] swarm logic that works by creating a "centroid" for each pack that they focus around, with the centroid moving slowly towards the goal, rather than the individual logic in knight-swarm
- [ ] logic to evaluate how good certain positions (mainly mars) are, e.g. in maps where they're mostly blocked off, rangers can still shoot; maybe it's better to land in a square with less karbonite because we can safely reach another isolated area
- [ ] ranger swarms
- [ ] special case logic for very tight locations
